## Abstract
This study explores advanced modeling techniques for time-series sales forecasting, focusing on Corporacion Favorita, a prominent grocery retailer in Ecuador. By leveraging data analytics and machine learning models such as XGBoost, Random Forest, ARIMA, and neural networks, the project aims to optimize inventory management and enhance operational efficiency. External factors like weather conditions and oil prices were integrated to improve predictive accuracy, offering actionable insights for the retail industry.

## Results

The study demonstrated that XGBoost was the most effective model for capturing sales patterns, achieving an R² of 0.9261 and significantly outperforming traditional methods like ARIMA and linear regression. Key findings highlight the impact of external factors, such as oil prices and weather conditions, on retail sales.
